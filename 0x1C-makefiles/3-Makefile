# Useful Makefile to compile school.c into a named executable
#  while using variables and multiple targets
# Having targets for cleanup

# Compiler to be used
CC=gcc

# Source files to be compiled
SRC=main.c school.c

# Object files to be linked into the final executable
OBJ=$(patsubst %.c,%.o,$(SRC))

# Name of the final executable
NAME=school

# The program used to delete files
RM=rm -f

# Target that builds the executable
all: $(OBJ)
	$(CC) $(OBJ) -o $(NAME)

%.o: %.c
	$(CC)    -c -o $@ $<

# Target that deletes all Emacs and Vim temporary files along with
#  the executable
clean:
	$(RM) *~ school

# Target that deletes all object files
oclean:
	$(RM) $(OBJ)

# Target that deletes all Emacs and Vim temporary files, the executable,
#  and the object files
fclean: clean oclean

# Target that forces recompilation of all source files
re: oclean all
